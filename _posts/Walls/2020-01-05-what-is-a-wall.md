A wall is a place to organize your notes.
It's all about what the notes are about,
whether that be for your family to share,
your diary, or a community of people you
may or may not like.

The wall is designed to gather people
to post similar notes. Whether that be
completely opposing political spectrum
or similar tastes in food and culture,
walls are the place to hold all your
conversations and ideas.
