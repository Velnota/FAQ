Walls are ways you can organize your notes, publicy
or privately. You can learn more about what you can
make these walls into here:

Historically, walls have been for:

- Inviting families and posting photos
- Organizing company/organization ideas to create better products
  or services
- Gather people of similar or completely different minds
  to generate ideas people could make (dreamers and makers, Republicans
  and Democrats, even just futurists).
- Create boards where new ideas could come to life
- Or simply just to post memes

Walls were originally named like that because the
founder/programmer [@Andrew](https://velnota.com/users/Andrew)
would tape notes on his wall whenever a new idea popped in
his mind. Whenever he had the time to go back to them,
all he needed to do was glance over, snatch a note off the
wall, and get to work making an idea a reality.
