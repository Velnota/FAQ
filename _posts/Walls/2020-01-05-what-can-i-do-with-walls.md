You can make the wall whatever you'd like
them to be. Here are just a few ideas:

- Inviting families and posting photos
- Organizing company/organization ideas to create better products
  or services
- Gather people of similar or completely different minds
  to generate ideas people could make (dreamers and makers, Republicans
  and Democrats, even just futurists).
- Create boards where new ideas could come to life
- Or simply just to post memes (every Bongo Cat version
  of a meme could be made with note extensions!)
- Gather your media presence in a single wall.

We made one of Velnota's walls a Feedback wall
for our users [here](https://velnota.com/walls/3/).
[@Andrew](https://velnota.com/users/Andrew/) created
a personal wall to host all his random ideas.
There's even a wall for his buddies to post some
pictures and some updates, just to chat.
