If you want to ban a user, update default permissions
for new members, or select a trustworthy member
to be an admin (who can delete other people's
content), you can:

1. Head to your wall's settings by clicking
   the gear icon in your wall's homepage:

![wall settings button](/assets/screenshots/wall-settings-button.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="2"}
2. Press Other Wall settings dropdown and
   select which one you want to go to. In
   this case, select "Members and Permissions."

![other wall settings](/assets/screenshots/other-wall-settings-dropdown.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="3"}
3. Here, you can update the default permissions (you must press
   the save button to update the default permissions):

![default permissions](/assets/screenshots/default-permissions.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="4"}
4. Or you can update an individual's permissions (you do not need to press
   the save button; no buttons are necessary to press here):

![individual permissions](/assets/screenshots/update-individual-permissions.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}
