short-description: Updating your users' permissions all at once

-----

1. To update all users' permissions (except for admins and
   the owner of the wall), go your wall's settings.

![wall settings button](/assets/screenshots/wall-settings-button.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="2"}
2. Press the "Other Settings" dropdown menu and select 
   "Members and Permissions".
   
![wall settings dropdown](/assets/screenshots/other-wall-settings-dropdown.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="3"}
3. Find the section that says "Update All Members' Permissions."
   Note: all members will still be able to view the note walls,
   regardless of the options. If you want to get rid of all the
   options, simply uncheck all of them. Your admins and the owner
   of the wall will not be effected. You can double check by the
   permissions table below.
