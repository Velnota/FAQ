There are two methods: if your wall is already created
or while building your wall.

### Already Built Wall

1. Go to your wall
2. Press the gear icon (settings):

![wall settings button](/assets/screenshots/wall-settings-button.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="3"}
3. Scroll to the bottom and tick a checkmark
   where it says "Create Invite"

![wall create invite](/assets/screenshots/wall-create-invite.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="4"}
4. Press Save
5. At the top, you should now see an invite link.
   Copy that link and share it with your friends!
   Note: this link will disappear. Make sure you save it!

### While Building

When creating your wall, you'll be asked to create an invite.
Tick the checkmark and follow steps 3-5 above.
