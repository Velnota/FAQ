-----

There are two methods: if your wall is already created
or while building your wall.

### Already Built Wall

If you're an admin, you can create an invitation link.
Otherwise, if you have the permission to invite users,
or the wall is public:

#### Public Wall or Have invite permission

1. Go to your wall
2. Press "Invite others to wall"

{: .img-responsive-md}

3. Select the family members you'd like to directly invite.

They will receive a notification in Velnota. They can click on the
notification and be directed to a page asking if they'd like to
accept the invitation or not.

#### Admin

1. Go to your wall
2. Press the gear icon (settings):

![wall settings button](/assets/screenshots/wall-settings-button.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="3"}
3. Scroll to the bottom and tick a checkmark
   where it says "Create Invite"

![wall create invite](/assets/screenshots/wall-create-invite.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="4"}
4. Press Save
5. At the top, you should now see an invite link.
   Copy that link and share it with your friends!
   Note: this link will appear in the settings.

### While Building

When creating your wall, you'll be asked to create an invite.
Tick the checkmark and follow steps 3-5 above.
