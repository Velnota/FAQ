If you find a comment worthy of more attention,
whether it's for or against the original
note's ideas, you can upvote or downvote on the
comment.

Find a comment and press one of the two hands.
The one pointing up is a positive feedback, and
the one pointing down is a negative feedback:

![Voting on a comment](/assets/screenshots/voting-on-a-comment.png)

We show both the number of upvotes and downvotes
to give an idea on how people perceive the comment
and how many people thought about it.

The more voting the better!
