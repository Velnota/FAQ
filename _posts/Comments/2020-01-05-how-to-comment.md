Commenting is a way to share your thoughts and opinions 
about the content or argue its proposition. To comment,
go to the comment section and press on the placeholder
text: "Comment your opinion"

Finally, start typing! Once you're done, just press the
comment button. You can also reply to others' comments
by pressing the "Reply" button:

### Making your stuff look good

We also support (GitHub flavored) markdown! Markdown 
allows you to make text big, bold, and even make 
hyperlinks. For example, if you comment:

```text
## A header

With some [hyperlinks](https://velnota.com) or none
like https://velnota.com/. You can ping a family
member's notification box like @michellobaeko.
You **could** quote *yourself*:

> Quoting myself

While also making a list:

- Hello there
- My name
- is Wall
```

Then, your comment will appear as:
