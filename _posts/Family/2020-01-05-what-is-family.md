short-description: Why Family, not just Friends?
---

-----

Family is awesome. They're not just friends,
they're the people you hang out with the most,
the lovable but direct human beings that you
talk to the most.

Whether you're an epidemiologist that wants to connect
with meteorologists, or a fashion blogger
that wants to talk directly connect with
fashion designers, Families at Velnota cherish just the
closest.

Yes, you can have 2000 friends, 5 million followers, or
200 celebrities retweeting you. **But** it's not the same
as asking for help with a fast response, or a tip by a 
[simple ping]({% post_url Family/2020-01-05-what-can-i-do-with-family %}).

We reserve the best features for just those 500 family
members. Cherish those who are truly closest to you!
