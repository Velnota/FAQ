Sometimes, family members can get annoying, or you decide against
inviting someone to your family, or want to edit your current allowable
relations with a user (e.g. allowing them to ping you). Then you have
two methods of doing so:

### 1. From your profile

1. Head to your profile by pressing "Your Profile" in the top
   navigation (you may have to open the menu first).
   
2. Press family (it should open a modal):

![Family modal button](/assets/screenshots/your-profile.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="3"}
3. Find your target and press edit on the right-hand side:

![Family modal](/assets/screenshots/editing-all-family-relations-from-you.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

### 2. From the target person's profile

1. Go to the other user's profile (you can type in
   https://velnota.com/users/THEIR-USERNAME):
   
2. You should now see a button saying "Edit your relationship." Press
   the button and edit your relationship.

{:start="3"}
3. If you don't see that button, it means they have either blocked
you, or you may be seeing a button saying "Invite to Family":
