3. You can fill out 4 email addresses with a personal message and custom name (the 
   name will appear as the "From" in the email, instead of saying "Velnota." This 
   makes the email a little more personal).
   
4. Press the preview button to see how your email looks.
5. If you're satisfied, press "Submit", and we'll deliver
   that email for you.
   
### Requesting to join

1. You can also request to join. Head to the signup page.
2. Click on the links that mention requesting to join.
3. Fill out your email and captcha and hit submit.
