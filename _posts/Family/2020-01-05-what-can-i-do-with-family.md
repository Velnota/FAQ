-----

Currently, the default with what you can
do with family members is ping them in your
notes and comments and publicly showing
you are a part of a person's family.

### Features
---
#### Pinging

To ping someone, you can write `@username`
(e.g. [@Andrew](https://velnota.com/users/Andrew)).
They'll receive a notification in their inbox
(in this example, the user "test" pinged "Andrew":

#### Being Public

When other users view another's profile, they can
view who is a part of their family. If you don't want
others to see you being a part of a certain user's
family, you can edit your relationship with that
user to adjust.

If you need help editing relationships, head to the
[Editing Relationships]({% post_url Family/2020-01-05-editing-relationships %})
page.

### Future Ideas

We're currently developing a messaging
platform and integrating some fun games
for people to play with.

You can submit more ideas to our 
[Velnota wall](https://velnota.com/wall/3/);
can't wait to hear them!
