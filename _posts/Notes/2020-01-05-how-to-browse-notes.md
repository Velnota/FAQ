You can view notes at the home page, your user profile, or
in your walls.

#### Viewing them on your profile

Press on the profile picture at the top right, then press "My Profile".
If you see a hamburger bar (three horizontal bars), press that and
then press "My Profile." You should arrive at screen like this:

![Your Profile](/assets/screenshots/your-profile.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

You can scroll through all your notes, select a wall, or just
your public notes to view:

![Wall selection](/assets/screenshots/viewing-your-walls.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

#### Viewing your wall's notes

Any wall that you own or are a part of can be easily accessible
from the homepage. First, click the "Velnota" logo to return to
the homepage. Then, in your sidebar or below the note creation form,
you can select a wall.

### Structure

Notes at Velnota are structured like a tree. On the home page,
we show the seeds of ideas. These are root notes. When you enter
the full note's page, you're able to see its extensions and comments.

Extending a note is like extending an idea, branching out from 
this note's original intentions. To share your thoughts or 
counterpoints on this note, comment rather than extend.

You can keep extending one branch's idea on and on. The point is
to keep thinking of new ideas, branching off from one another's
thoughts. The point is you can keep going down a rabbit hole
and make an ant farm of ideas.

You can learn more about the concept of extensions here:
