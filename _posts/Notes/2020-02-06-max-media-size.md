## Images

All images (including gifs) are maxed out at 3.75 MB, regardless
if it's for a note or profile picture. However, beforehand,
we'll try to compress your images (excluding gifs) in the browser,
so you may still be able to upload images that exceed the limit.

## Videos

Videos can only be 50 MB large.
