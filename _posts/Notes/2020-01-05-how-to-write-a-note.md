short-description: Using Markdown to Write a Note
---

-----

The basis for all ideas starts with a pencil
and paper. To begin, head to the homepage
or a certain wall, and type in a title and 
some content.

{: .img-responsive-md}

You can also post in a specific wall by pressing
the "Post In" button and selecting the target wall.

### Note Extensions

Every idea starts with one note. **But** we want
to build upon each other's ideas. To write a note
extension, go into a specific note, press "Extend
current note's idea," and start typing like you
would on the homepage:

![homepage](/assets/screenshots/extending-a-note.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

To learn why note extensions are core to all ideas,

### Making your stuff look good

We also support (GitHub flavored) markdown! Markdown 
allows you to make text big, bold, and even make 
hyperlinks. For example, if you comment:

```text
## A header

With some [hyperlinks](https://velnota.com) or none
like https://velnota.com/. You can ping a family
member's notification box like @michellobaeko.
You **could** quote *yourself*:

> Quoting myself

While also making a list:

- Hello there
- My name
- is Wall
```

Then, your note will appear as:
