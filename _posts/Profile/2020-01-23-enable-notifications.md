Want to change which notifications to receive? Refer to: 
[Changing which Notifications to Receive]({% post_url Profile/2020-01-23-change-notifications-settings %})

### Desktop
We only send notifications if you are currently logged in on the website.
If you see "Web Push" or "Push Notifications," Velnota does not use that
annoying technology on your computer, so you can safely ignore those.

When you see a notification, **you can click on it to be directed to
the extended note, family invite, or pinged location**.

Reference your favorite browser:
- [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3220216?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
- [Firefox (Section: Upgraded Notifications only)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox)
- [Safari](https://browserhow.com/how-to-allow-or-stop-notification-settings-in-safari-mac/)
- [Edge](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-manage-web-notifications-edge-windows-10)
- [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#notifications)

Several websites may appear. Select "Allow" to allow notifications while
using the website or "Deny" when you don't. The words may vary depending
on the browser you're using.
