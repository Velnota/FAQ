### Changing your profile picture
1. Press on the profile picture at the top and select "Settings."
   If you see a hamburger bar (three horizontal bars), press that and
   then press "Settings."

![Top Nav](/assets/screenshots/topnav.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="2"}
2. Press Edit and select Upload a photo

### Random Tips

What should I upload? Whatever you desire! Don't make yourself
look flashy (no nudity please). You want to look like yourself
in your photos not to impress others but to impress yourself
later in life
