### Changing your profile picture
1. Just press "My Profile" at the top of the website. If you see
   a hamburger bar (three horizontal bars), press that and
   then press "My Profile." You should arrive at screen like this:

![Your Profile](/assets/screenshots/your-profile.png)
{: .img-responsive-md}

{:start="2"}
2. Press "My Info"
3. Press Change Picture and select a picture

### Random Tips

What should I upload? Whatever you desire! Don't make yourself
look flashy (no nudity please). You want to look like yourself
in your photos not to impress others but to impress yourself
later in life
